A Lego Mindstorms NXT sumo robot running nxtOSEK
================================================

A quite simple sumo robot built upon nxtOSEK.

Usage
-----
Edit Makefile to point out paths to your nxtOSEK distribution and NeXTTool.

There's an [ldd] model file included in the repo for the robot I've used to
test this code on. Note however that due to limitations in the tool some parts
of the robot ain't mounted but it should be easy to figure it out.
